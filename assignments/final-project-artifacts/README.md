Reproduce a simple hypothesis-only baseline on a natural language inference dataset and analyse spurious correlations.

## Suggested steps
- Sample a few hundred NLI examples and construct a hypothesis-only classifier.
- Evaluate performance versus a random baseline.
- Reflect on dataset artifacts, ethical considerations, and avenues for improvement.

# Assignment A3 Â· Tiny Transformer Language Model

Train and evaluate a small transformer-based language model on a character dataset.

## Tasks
- Implement data loading and batching utilities for a tiny corpus.
- Define a transformer encoder-decoder or decoder-only architecture using PyTorch.
- Track loss during training (skip heavy training in CI by guarding long runs with `if CI:` checks).

    "Focuses on explaining individual predictions by highlighting what parts of the input influenced the model It might first mention LIME (Ribeiro et al. 2016) which generates a local linear approximation of the model by perturbing input features (words) and seeing how predictions change, then highlights important words (e.g., for sentiment classification, LIME might underline ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù and ‚Äúboring‚Äù to show their effects)."

    "- 2016 which did this for image classification (generating a sentence like ‚Äúbecause the bird has a red head‚Ä¶‚Äù to justify the label - though image domain, principle applies to text).\n",
    "- Camburu et al.\n",
    "- 2018 e-SNLI provided human-written explanations for NLI labels and trained a model to generate those - so the model can output, say, ‚ÄúEntailment because the person is doing something that implies the first sentence‚Äù or ‚ÄúContradiction because the second sentence negates the first.‚Äù This made a corpus to supervise explanation generation.\n",
    "- The video likely weighs the value of such textual explanations: they are human-frien and can be more complete than highlights (e.g., covering multi-step reasoning)."

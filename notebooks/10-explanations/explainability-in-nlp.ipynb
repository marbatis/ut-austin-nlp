    "## Overview\n",
    "Sets the stage by discussing why interpretability matters and what it means Possibly referencing Lipton's ‚ÄúMythos of Model Interpretability‚Äù (2016) which argues that interpretability is often ill-defined, and enumerates categories (transparency of model vs. post-hoc explanations) The video might summarize that paper: e.g., types of explanations include textual or visual explanations, feature importance (like highlighting input parts), model internals understanding (like analyzing weights or attention), and example-based (like showing similar past cases)."

    "- It warns of explanation myths - e.g., just because a model is simple doesn't mean it's right or ‚Äúthe truth‚Äù; or that an explanation might not faithfully reflect the model's true reasoning.\n",
    "- The video likely motivates that with deep models making decisions, we often need to verify why - for user trust, for debugging biases, for regulatory compliance, etc.\n",
    "- It might mention how earlier simpler models (like linear models or decision trees) had more straightforward interpretability (weights, rules), whereas deep nets require more work to interpret.\n",

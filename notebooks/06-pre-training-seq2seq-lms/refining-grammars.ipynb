    "## Overview\n",
    "Discusses improvements to basic PCFG parsing by refining grammar rules to better capture context It likely refers to the work of Klein & Manning (2003) which found that an unlexicalized PCFG can be made much more accurate by splitting non-terminals into more fine-grained categories based on context (like parent annotation, subcategorization, etc.) The video explains that vanilla PCFGs, trained on a treebank like Penn Treebank, underperform because they don't account for context sensitivity - e.g., a rule NP -> DT NN might have different likelihood depending on whether NP is subject or object position, etc. By refining a grammar (for instance, annotate an NP with whether it's under S as subject vs."

    "- under VP as object, or annotate a verb phrase with its head verb's subcategorization), we effectively increase the grammar state space, leading to a more precise model that fits data better.\n",
    "- The included reading likely is Klein & Manning (2003) on \"Accurate Unlexicalized Parsing\" which achieved nearly state-of-the-art (at that time) by clever symbol splitting without full lexicalization.\n",
    "- The video might give examples of splits: splitting the tag for a noun (NN) into NN^S (if under S, maybe a subject) vs NN^PP (if under a PP), etc., and how it improved parse disambiguation.\n",
    "- Another concept is binarization of grammar (transform grammar into CNF which can blow up number of rules too, but needed for CKY - maybe mentioned in passing)."

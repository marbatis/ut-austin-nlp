    "## Overview\n",
    "Describes the Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm, a dynamic programming method for parsing (especially suited for CNF grammars) The video likely demonstrates CKY on a short sentence with a simple grammar. CKY works by filling a table where cell [i,j] (i = start word index, j = end index) holds all possible constituents (non-terminals) that can span from word i to word j of the sentence."

    "## Key ideas\n",
    "- It does this by checking splits: for each possible split k between i and j, and for each rule X -> Y Z, if Y is in [i,k] and Z is in [k,j], then X can be in [i,j].\n",
    "- The video might show a triangular matrix being filled: first the diagonal with preterminal tags for each word (via lexical rules), then length-2 spans, etc., up to the full length covering [0,n] which if contains S means the sentence can be parsed.\n",
    "- This yields all possible parse trees (implicitly) and by adding probabilities (like a PCFG), one can compute the max probability parse similarly (this is akin to Viterbi adaptation of CKY).\n",
    "- The reading (Eisenstein 10.3.1) covers CKY clearly The video likely gives pseudocode or an example with say the grammar: S->NP VP, NP-> Det N, etc., and the sentence \"Det N V Det N\"."

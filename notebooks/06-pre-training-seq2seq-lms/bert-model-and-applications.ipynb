    "## Overview\n",
    "Continues on BERT by describing the architecture more and how BERT is applied to downstream tasks It likely covers that BERT-base has 12 layers, 768 hidden size, 12 heads (~110M params) and BERT-large double that etc., giving a sense of scale. Then it discusses how to fine-tune BERT: for classification tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis or entailment), you take BERT's [CLS] token output and put a small classifier on top and train on the task data."

    "## Key ideas\n",
    "- For span extraction QA (like SQuAD), you take BERT's output for each token and train two classifiers to pick start and end of answer span.\n",
    "- Possibly also mention BERT can be used for token-level tasks (like POS tagging or NER) by feeding the token outputs into a classifier for labels.\n",
    "- The video might use an example: GLUE benchmark - a suite of sentence or sentence-pair tasks (SST-2 sentiment, MNLI entailment, etc.) where fine-tuned BERT excelled It might highlight a few specific tasks and how BERT's fine-tuning is set up for each.\n",
    "- Another application: mention BERT for QA (which will be elaborated in Week 11) - that BERT achieved very high accuracy on SQuAD by effectively reading paragraphs with its bidirectional attention."

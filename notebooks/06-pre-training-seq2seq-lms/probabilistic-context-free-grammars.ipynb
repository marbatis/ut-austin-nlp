    "## Overview\n",
    "Introduces PCFGs, which add probabilities to CFG rules so that we can choose between ambiguous parses by comparing their probability The video explains that each grammar production rule A -> B C (or A -> \"word\") is given a probability, such that for each non-terminal A, the probabilities of all rules expanding A sum to 1. For example, a PCFG might have P(VP -> V NP) = 0.5 and P(VP -> V NP PP) = 0.3, P(VP -> V) = 0.2, meaning in the training treebank, 50% of VPs have a direct object, 30% have direct object + prepositional phrase, etc."

    "- Then the probability of a full parse tree is the product of probabilities of all rules used in that tree.\n",
    "- The video likely describes how one estimates these rule probabilities from a parsed corpus (just relative frequency of rule occurrences).\n",
    "- Then given a new sentence, we want the parse tree with highest probability.\n",
    "- It notes that this is analogous to HMM tagging but with hierarchical structures - we can still use dynamic programming (like a variant of CKY that accumulates probabilities, often called the \"inside algorithm\" for PCFGs, and \"Viterbi inside\" for best parse)."

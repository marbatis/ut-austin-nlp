    "## Key ideas\n",
    "- T5's philosophy: ‚Äútreat every NLP task as a text-to-text problem.‚Äù The video explains that T5 uses a similar architecture (Transformer encoder-decoder) and is pre-trained on a massive corpus (C4, a huge cleaned web crawl) with a denoising objective like filling in dropped-out spans (they call it ‚Äúspan corruption‚Äù).\n",
    "- Essentially, T5 is like BART in concept, but it also establishes a unified framework for tasks: For example, to do translation with T5, you feed in ‚Äútranslate English to German: <sentence>‚Äù and train it to output the German.\n",
    "- For sentiment, feed ‚Äússt2 sentence: <sentence>‚Äù and output ‚Äúpositive‚Äù or ‚Äúnegative‚Äù.\n",
    "- All tasks are cast as feeding some text prompt into the model and letting it generate the answer in text form The video likely emphasizes this uniformity - it simplifies multi-task learning and the interface to the model."

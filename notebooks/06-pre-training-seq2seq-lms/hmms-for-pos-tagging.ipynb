    "## Overview\n",
    "Likely demonstrates using an HMM tagger on actual data or discusses one of the classic HMM-based taggers (like Brants' TnT tagger, 2000) Thorsten Brants' TnT was a trigram HMM tagger with some suffix han known to hit ~96-97% accuracy and was very fast. The video might mention features they used: e.g., han unknown words by using capitalization, suffixes (like ‚Äú-ing‚Äù likely VBG), etc., which can be folded into the emission probabilities by some smoothing technique."

    "- It might also reference that this was the state of the art in late 90s/early 2000s - a purely statistical approach that's relatively simple, yet effective.\n",
    "- The reading by Brants (2000) might be cited as an example of a high-performance POS tagger using HMMs.\n",
    "- This could segway into improvements: e.g., Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs) or Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) were introduced to overcome some HMM limitations by allowing arbitrary features in emissions and focusing on conditional probability P(tags|words).\n",
    "- The video might not dive deep if CRFs come later, but at least hint that there are discriminative counterparts."

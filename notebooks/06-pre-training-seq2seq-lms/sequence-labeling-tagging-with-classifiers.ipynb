    "## Overview\n",
    "Discusses an approach to POS tagging (or similar sequence labeling tasks) using independent classifiers for each position coupled with some heuristi to enforce consistency One strategy is a greedy classifier-based tagger: slide through the sentence, at each word use features (like the word itself, neighboring words, maybe previous predicted tag) to predict the tag. The video likely describes a simple algorithm: use a logistic regression or perceptron that takes as input [current word, previous word, next word, maybe suffix/prefix of word, etc.] and outputs a tag."

    "## Key ideas\n",
    "- You could incorporate the previous predicted tag as a feature to add sequential dependence (this yields a first-order dependency and effectively is like a simplified CRF).\n",
    "- This is essentially the approach taken by early taggers like the Greedy Averaged Perceptron tagger (Collins 2002) or even the NLTK default tagger approach.\n",
    "- The video might mention Eisenstein 7.1 (which covers basic sequence labeling and MEMM/CRF introduction) It highlights that while this classifier approach can work decently and is easy to implement, it might suffer from the label bias problem or error propagation (if you get one tag wrong, it might negatively affect the next).\n",
    "- This naturally motivates structured models like HMM or CRF where you consider the sequence globally rather than one-step greedy decisions."

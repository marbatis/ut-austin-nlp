    "Shifts to the important detail of how these models han vocabulary: subword tokenization The video explains that models like BERT, GPT, T5, etc., don't operate on characters or full words directly, but on subword units (to keep vocabulary to a manageable size yet cover any text). It likely covers WordPiece (used by BERT and others) and BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding) (used by GPT-2/3, etc.)."

    "## Key ideas\n",
    "- The algorithm: Start with individual characters and iteratively merge the most frequent pair of tokens into one, building a vocabulary of subwords.\n",
    "- This way, common words become single tokens, rare words get split into meaningful chunks (e.g., ‚Äúunhappiness‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúun##happy##ness‚Äù in WordPiece notation with ## indicating continuation).\n",
    "- The video might demonstrate a toy BPE merge process or show how a word like ‚Äúinternationalization‚Äù might be tokenized (‚Äúinternational@@ ization‚Äù or so).\n",
    "- It emphasizes benefits: any input word can be represented (like even a misspelling or a new name, by decomposing into subwords or characters), and frequent patterns are encoded efficiently (the model can learn that ‚Äúization‚Äù at the end of words often has a certain meaning)."

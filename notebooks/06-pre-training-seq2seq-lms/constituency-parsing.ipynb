    "## Overview\n",
    "Shifts to syntactic parsing, starting with Constituency (phrase-structure) parsing It explains the goal: produce a tree that groups words into nested constituents (NP, VP, etc.), reflecting the grammar of the sentence. For example, for “The cat sat on the mat”, produce a tree with an NP (“The cat”) and a VP (“sat on the mat”), etc."

    "## Key ideas\n",
    "- The video likely introduces the concept of a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) and how sentences can be derived from a grammar (with rules like S -> NP VP, NP -> DET N, etc.).\n",
    "- It might show a small grammar and how a sentence parse corresponds to applying those rules.\n",
    "- It also mentions that constituency parses were historically important for many tasks and still used for certain linguistic analysis.\n",
    "- The reading (Eisenstein 10.1-10.2) covers CFG basi The video sets up that parsing can be seen as finding the best (or all) parse tree consistent with a grammar for a given sentence."

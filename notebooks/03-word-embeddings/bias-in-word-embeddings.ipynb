    "An important discussion on how word embeddings can capture biases present in their training corpora. This video explains that because embeddings are learned from real-world text, they may reflect societal stereotypes and biases in that text."

    "## Key ideas\n",
    "- For example, the notorious analogy result “man : computer programmer :: woman : homemaker” was found in embeddings illustrating a gender bias: the model associated men with technical occupations and women with domestic roles.\n",
    "- The lecture likely quantifies bias using metri like the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) and gives examples of gender, ethnic, or racial biases that have been observed (e.g., “doctor” closer to “he” and “nurse” to “she”).\n",
    "- The included references underscore this: Bolukbasi et al.\n",
    "- (2016) explicitly addressed the gender bias in embeddings and proposed a method to “debias” them by zeroing out the gender direction However, later works like Manzini et al."

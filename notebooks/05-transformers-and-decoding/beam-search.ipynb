    "Introduces Beam Search, a decoding algorithm for generating sequences from models (like translation or dialogue systems) in a more optimal way than naive greedy choice. The video explains that at each time step, instead of choosing only the best next word, beam search keeps track of the top B (beam width) partial hypotheses (sequences) and extends each of them."

    "- It then prunes to the top B of those extensions, and repeats.\n",
    "- This finds a higher probability complete sequence than greedy might, because it can recover from local optima by exploring multiple candidates in parallel.\n",
    "- The lecture might give a small example: suppose the model at first word gives probabilities: ‚ÄúI‚Äù (0.4), ‚ÄúThe‚Äù (0.3), ‚ÄúA‚Äù (0.2), ...; a beam of size 2 would keep ‚ÄúI‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe‚Äù.\n",
    "- Next word, each of those expands to a few possibilities, and we keep the best 2 overall two-word sequences, and so on."

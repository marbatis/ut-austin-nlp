    "Focuses on using a Transformer for the task of Language Modeling, which is directly relevant to Assignment 3. The video likely describes how one sets up a Transformer (usually a decoder-only or a stack of transformer blocks with causal masking) to model text sequences."

    "## Key ideas\n",
    "- It might mention the example of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) which is essentially a many-layer transformer decoder trained on massive text data to predict the next word.\n",
    "- It explains that unlike sequence-to-sequence tasks, for plain language modeling we don't need an encoder-decoder structure; we can just use the decoder part with self-attention masked to not see future words.\n",
    "- During training, you feed in a long sequence and train it to predict each next token (like an extension of how we trained RNN LMs, but now with a transformer).\n",
    "- The advantages could be reiterated: self-attention lets the model look at far-back context efficiently, and multiple layers allow complex conditioning."

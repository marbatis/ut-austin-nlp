    "## Overview\n",
    "Dives into the training algorithm for neural networks, namely backpropagation. It starts by describing the architecture of a feedforward neural network (also known as a multilayer perceptron) in more detail: input layer ‚Üí one or more hidden layers (with nonlinear activations) ‚Üí output layer."

    "## Key ideas\n",
    "- The key new challenge here is how to adjust all those weights in potentially multiple layers, given an error from the output.\n",
    "- The video explains backpropagation as the method to compute gradients efficiently for each weight by recursively applying the chain rule of calculus from the output layer back to the input.\n",
    "- In practical terms, it might outline a simple 2-layer network: first compute the forward pass (calculate outputs), then measure the error (loss), and then propagate that error backward: compute the gradient at the output layer, then for the hidden layer by seeing how much each hidden neuron contributed to the output error, etc.\n",
    "- The lecturer likely reassures that while the math can seem heavy, conceptually it's just ‚Äúthe credit assignment‚Äù problem - figuring out which weights were responsible for how much of the error, so we can change them accordingly."

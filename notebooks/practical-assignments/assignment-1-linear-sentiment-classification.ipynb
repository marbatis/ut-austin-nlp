    "Build a classic sentiment classifier over movie reviews using linear models. You will extract sparse textual features (unigrams, bigrams, etc.), train perceptron/logistic regression models, and evaluate how feature design impacts accuracy. The assignment reinforces Week 1 content on linear decision boundaries, loss minimisation, and evaluation workflows."

    "- Engineer lexical features (e.g., bag-of-words, n-grams, binary vs. count features) and examine their effect on accuracy.\n",
    "- Implement and compare the perceptron and logistic regression learners for binary sentiment classification.\n",
    "- Split data into train/dev/test, tune hyperparameters (learning rate, number of epochs), and report metrics with error analysis.\n",
    "- Document observations that connect back to Week 1 lecture material on linear models and optimization."

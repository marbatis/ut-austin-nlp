    "- Select a dataset/task (e.g., NLI, QA, sentiment) and identify potential artifacts the model might exploit.\n",
    "- Design experiments to expose artifacts (control experiments, adversarial examples, probing).\n",
    "- Implement mitigation strategies such as data augmentation, debiasing, or diagnostic evaluation to measure improvements.\n",
    "- Produce a research-style report contextualising findings with related work (e.g., Gururangan et al. 2018)."

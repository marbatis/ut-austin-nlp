    "## Overview\n",
    "Discusses how to evaluate language models, introducing Perplexity as the main metric. The video defines perplexity (PP) of a model on a test set as the geometric mean of the inverse probability the model assigns to each word (or essentially exp of the average negative log-likelihood) It explains that a lower perplexity means the model is less ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù by the test data - hence a better model."

    "## Key ideas\n",
    "- For example, if a model has perplexity 50, it's as uncertain as if it had to choose among 50 equally likely words at each step on average.\n",
    "- The lecture might demonstrate computing perplexity on a tiny example for clarity.\n",
    "- It also covers cross-entropy as an information-theoretic measure related to log-likelihood, noting that minimizing cross-entropy is equivalent to maximizing likelihood, and perplexity is just 2^(cross-entropy) if logs are base 2.\n",
    "- Additionally, the video might highlight that perplexity is an intrinsic evaluation - it measures how well the model predicts data, but not directly how useful the model is for any downstream task."

    "Builds on the concept of attention to explain Self-Attention, where a sequence attends to itself. The key scenario introduced is likely the Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) where self-attention is extensively used."

    "## Key ideas\n",
    "- The video explains that in self-attention, each word in a sequence looks at other words in the same sequence to gather context.\n",
    "- For example, consider a sentence: ‚ÄúThe bank near the river was overflowing.‚Äù To encode ‚Äúbank‚Äù meaningfully, self-attention allows the model to look at ‚Äúriver‚Äù (and maybe ‚Äúoverflowing‚Äù) to understand ‚Äúbank‚Äù here means river bank, not financial institution.\n",
    "- Concretely, the video might describe how we compute self-attention: we have queries, keys, and values (linear projections of the word's embedding or hidden state).\n",
    "- For each word as a query, we take dot products with all words' keys to get attention weights, and then use those to sum up value vectors, producing a new representation for that word that integrates information from the others It likely uses a small example to demonstrate: maybe 3-word sequence, showing how each word's new representation is a weighted mix of all three original word vectors."

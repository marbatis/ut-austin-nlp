    "Introduces the attention mechanism, a game-changing concept first developed in the context of Neural Machine Translation by Bahdanau et al. (2015) The video likely starts by explaining the problem in translation that led to attention: in an encoder-decoder RNN model, the encoder compresses a source sentence into a single vector, which the decoder then uses to produce the target sentence."

    "## Key ideas\n",
    "- This was problematic for long sentences - the fixed vector bottleneck lost a lot of detail, and the decoder had no explicit access to specific parts of the source when generating a given target word.\n",
    "- Attention was proposed as a solution where, for each word the decoder generates, it can attend to (focus on) different parts of the source sentence dynamically.\n",
    "- The lecturer probably illustrates this with an example: translating ‚ÄúThe cat sat on the mat‚Äù to French.\n",
    "- When generating the word ‚Äúchat‚Äù (cat in French), the attention mechanism will look at the source words and put high weight on ‚Äúcat‚Äù."

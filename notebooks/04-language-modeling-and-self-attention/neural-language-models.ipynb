    "Transitions to Neural Network-based language models, which overcome some limitations of n-gram models. The video likely recalls that in Week 3 we learned how to represent words with embeddings; now we can feed those into a neural sequence model to predict the next word."

    "- Perhaps it starts with the older model by Bengio et al.\n",
    "- (2003) - a feedforward neural LM that used a fixed context (like 4 previous words) but projected them into embeddings and used a hidden layer to predict the next word, dramatically reducing parameters via shared embeddings.\n",
    "- Then it leads into Recurrent Neural Networks, which don't have a fixed context window but instead maintain a hidden state that carries information from all prior words (in theory)."

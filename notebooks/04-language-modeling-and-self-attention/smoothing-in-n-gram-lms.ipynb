    "## Overview\n",
    "Addresses how to han zero probabilities and improve estimates in n-gram models via smoothing techniques. The video likely starts with the simplest method, Laplace (add-1) smoothing, explaining that we pretend we saw each possible n-gram at least once to avoid zeros (so add 1 to all counts and adjust probabilities accordingly)."

    "- It then moves to more sophisticated methods like Good-Turing discounting (reallocating some probability mass from seen n-grams to unseen ones) and Interpolation/backoff strategies.\n",
    "- For instance, backoff: if an n-gram has zero count, back off to using an (n-1)-gram probability.\n",
    "- Or interpolation: always combine trigram, bigram, and unigram probabilities with certain weights The video probably emphasizes Kneser-Ney smoothing, one of the best methods: explaining its intuition that not all contexts are equally novel - it redistributes probabilities in a clever way by considering how likely a word is to appear as a novel continuation.\n",
    "- This could be high-level since full Kneser-Ney details are complex, but the key idea is conveyed that it adjusts for how likely context is to produce new words."

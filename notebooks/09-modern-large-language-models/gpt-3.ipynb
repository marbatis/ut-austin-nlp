    "Discusses GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3), the 2020 OpenAI model that truly popularized LLM capabilities. The video outlines GPT-3's scale (175 billion parameters) and how it's an extension of the earlier GPT-2 architecture but vastly bigger and trained on more data."

    "- It explains GPT-3's breakthrough: it can perform many tasks via prompting alone - e.g., given a question in English, it can answer it; given a short story prompt, it can continue it; given a few examples of a translation, it can do more translations - all without fine-tuning.\n",
    "- This is introduced as unsupervised multitask learning or “few-shot learning in-context”.\n",
    "- The reading by Radford et al.\n",
    "- 2019 might be GPT-2's paper titled \"Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners\" (the famous GPT-2 blog/paper) and Brown et al."

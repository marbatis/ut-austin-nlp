    "## Overview\n",
    "Presents Logistic Regression, a fundamental statistical classifier, and contrasts it with the perceptron. The video explains how logistic regression predicts a probability for the positive class by applying the logistic (sigmoid) function to the linear combination of features This yields an S-shaped curve where very negative weighted sums give probabilities near 0 and very positive sums near 1, providing a smooth output."

    "## Key ideas\n",
    "- The training objective for logistic regression is to maximize the likelihood of the training labels (or equivalently minimize the logistic loss), which is achieved by gradient ascent/descent.\n",
    "- The lecture likely goes through an example: given a sentence's features, the model outputs, say, 0.8 probability of ‚Äúpositive‚Äù, meaning it's fairly confident.\n",
    "- It shows how, if the label is 1 (positive), the loss is low, but if the label were 0, the loss would be high - driving weight updates.\n",
    "- Logistic regression is praised for its probabilistic interpretation and a loss that is differentiable (unlike perceptron's step function), making it amenable to optimization."

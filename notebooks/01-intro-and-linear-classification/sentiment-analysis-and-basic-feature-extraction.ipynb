    "- It covers simple but powerful text features such as unigram presence (does a word appear or not), word frequency counts, and possibly bigrams (pairs of consecutive words) to capture simple context.\n",
    "- The video likely walks through an example of converting a sentence like \"This movie is not bad at all\" into a feature vector, illustrating choices like whether to lowercase words, remove stopwords, or han negations (‚Äúnot bad‚Äù as a phrase).\n",
    "- The purpose is to show that how you represent text greatly affects a model's performance.\n",
    "- This practical discussion connects to the Pang et al."
